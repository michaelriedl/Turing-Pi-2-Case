## Acrylic Pieces
The DXF files for cutting the acrylic pieces are in the ```/dxf``` folder. The inner cuts are in red so that you can order the cut operations to cut the inner details before cutting the outer perimeter.

## 3D Printed Pieces
The STL files for printing the legs and I/O shield are in the ```/stl``` folder. I printed the parts in PLA with 0.35mm layer height slicing settings and got good results and reasonable print times.
